Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

Pehla nasha, pehla khumaar
Naya pyaar hai, naya intezaar
Kar loon main kya apna haal
Ae dil-e-beqaraar
Mere dil-e-beqaraar, tu hi bata

(I) x5

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you (

Udtaa hi phiroon in hawaaon mein kahin
Ya main jhool jaaoon in ghataaon mein kahin
Ek kar doon aasmaan aur zameen
Kaho yaaron kya karoon, kya nahin

Pehla nasha, pehla khumaar (
Naya pyaar hai, naya intezaar
Kar loon main kya apna haal
Ae dil-e-beqaraar
Mere dil-e-beqaraar, tu hi bata

And the memories bring back, memories bring back you
